The handsome country singer released a number of big hits, including the 2018 "Cowboy Style" and the 2016 "This Is Me."</p><p>But it wasn't just his catchy tunes that completely enamored fans. His wife, Criscilla Crossland Anderson, was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and the couple has decided to document their ups and downs in the Netflix docuseries <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Ever After.&nbsp;</a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Coffey Anderson?

I mean, I never thought I would be helping Criscilla brush her teeth or get to the bathroom in the middle of the night. But we are willing to do it for each other. Each of us are giving 100 percent," Coffey said in a 2019 interview with People.</p><p>The Netflix series Country Ever After shows the couple raising their three kids, navigating their successful careers, and Criscilla's battle with cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've been through seven rounds of chemo," the hip-hop dancer says in the trailer.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Coffey and Criscilla have been together for 11 years, and have three children, the 9-year-old Ethan, 7-year-old Enmarie, and 3-year-old Everleigh. The family had an idyllic life before Criscilla was diagnosed with the illness.&nbsp;</p><p>And, fans can expect that this heartfelt reality series will bring lots of tears. So, grab your box of tissues!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Criscilla opens up about her colon cancer symptoms.</h2><p>The hip-hop dancer initially began to experience bouts of stomach issues in 2018. However, she didn't think much of it and didn't seek help until much later.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, she was asked to perform at a dance event in Kentucky. This time, the symptoms turned out to be too severe. She had to cancel the show and called for an emergency doctor visit instead.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Even at that time, the mother-of-three wasn't diagnosed with cancer immediately. As she told People in 2019, the doctors originally believed that the pain was the result of colitis and sent her home with antibiotics.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when the same problem occurred a few days later, she began to suspect that something much more dangerous was at stake.&nbsp;</p><p>During her next visit to the hospital, the doctors attempted to perform a colonoscopy and discovered a large tumor in her colon.&nbsp;</p><p>"The cancer has spread throughout my para-aortic region and has begun growing up my back," she revealed. The diagnosis sparked her to take immediate action. She opted for a combination of holistic therapy and chemotherapy approach to treatment.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"Life is not fair, but God is always good," Coffey, who has continued to be his wife's No.1 supporter, told People. Recalling a childhood memory, he described how his father would carry his mother — who suffered from lung cancer — around the house, insisting that he is ready to do the same for his wife. &nbsp;</p><p>The "This Is Me" singer is widely renowned for his optimism and positivity, which he continues to maintain.</p><p>Watch Coffey and Criscilla's journey in the Netflix docuseries Country Ever After, premiering on Nov. 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJynlpuyunnAp5ueqqOkuw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-coffey-anderson.html&text=Coffey%20Anderson%20and%20Wife%20Document%20Her%20Colon%20Cancer%20Battle%20in%20%27Country%20Ever%20After%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-coffey-anderson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-coffey-anderson.html&title=Coffey%20Anderson%20and%20Wife%20Document%20Her%20Colon%20Cancer%20Battle%20in%20%27Country%20Ever%20After%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-coffey-anderson.html&title=Coffey%20Anderson%20and%20Wife%20Document%20Her%20Colon%20Cancer%20Battle%20in%20%27Country%20Ever%20After%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-coffey-anderson.html&title=Coffey%20Anderson%20and%20Wife%20Document%20Her%20Colon%20Cancer%20Battle%20in%20%27Country%20Ever%20After%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-coffey-anderson.html&description=Coffey%20Anderson%20and%20Wife%20Document%20Her%20Colon%20Cancer%20Battle%20in%20%27Country%20Ever%20After%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pdp-governorship-aspirant-dagogo-taken-to-hospital-from-police-custody.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="PDP Governorship Aspirant, Dagogo Taken To Hospital From Police Custody">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rotimi-amaechi-is-arrogant-he-told-his-supporters-to-vote-against-tinubu-okocha.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rotimi Amaechi Is Arrogant, He Told His Supporters To Vote Against Tinubu">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
