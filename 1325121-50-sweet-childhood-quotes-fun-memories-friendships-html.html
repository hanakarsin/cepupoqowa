The first thing continues forever with the young one. The first joy, the first sorrow, the first success, the first failure, the first achievement, the first misadventure paints the foreground of his life.</li><li>We see how early childhood experiences are so important to lifelong outcomes, how the early environment literally becomes embedded in the brain and changes its architecture.</li><li>Enjoy the little things; one day, you may look back and realize they were the big things.</li><li>There is a garden in every childhood, an enchanted place where colors are brighter, the air softer, and the morning more fragrant than ever again.</li><li>Some days I wish I could go back in life.
