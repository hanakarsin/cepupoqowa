The Kenya business directory will most likely get you more of the top tier international companies operating in the country, but it suffices to say these are definitely on top of the league.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fca20145dcc38799.jpeg><p class=align-left>Most companies incorporated in Europe, for example, are public companies with shares listed in some of the popular capital markets around Europe. So are the Japanese companies like Toyota whose shares are listed on the Tokyo stock exchange. On the hand, most of the Chinese business in Kenya is run by companies wholly owned by the Chinese state. This is true for companies like CGTN, China-Africa Development Fund, Xinhua, and the Bank of China.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Best success wishes for exams</p><p class=align-left>In their areas of operation, the Chinese companies have a business model that quickly see them emerge as the topmost performers in their respective field. The strategy includes ready funding from Chinese banks and sometimes direct contracts resulting from the government to government negotiations between the Kenyan and Chinese governments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4cff06d032a1a248.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 richest people in Asia and their net worth in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the other hand, most of the companies outside the arrangement sometimes have to jostle for market share with some of the best private companies in Kenya. With enhanced efficiency and streamlined management structures with little squabbles, however, the international companies do not take long to grow in the market.</p><p class=align-left>In its niche, for example, Coca-Cola maintains a near market monopoly as it maintains a widespread grip on the beverages market in Kenya. With a huge financial muscle and experience of many years, the company has created a competitive edge. Mostly this is through intensive and extensive advertisement campaigns. Colored television ads, well-worded radio ads, catchy billboards, and well-timed roadshows throughout the country.</p><p class=align-left>Another aspect of their campaigns is their involvement in local activities like sponsoring a football tournament, sponsoring local leagues, and other community-based competitions. Unless a competitor builds a financial war chest, it will be difficult to get some market share off Coca-Cola.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1c75ef6a6b09c657.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of SMEs in Kenya: Top 100 companies to watch in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But it is not always so easy for multinational corporations sometimes local companies have taken roots, and they fight back fiercely against competitors. Bharti Airtel for example despite its international experience across the globe has found it hard to penetrate the Safaricom dominated telecommunications sector. Some companies like YU just had to give up and leave the market despite their international appeal.</p><p class=align-left>Others in the telecommunication industry like orange with investments from France are still struggling to penetrate the market. The Majority local owned Safaricom has packaged itself in a manner that it locks in users. Be it as it may, it is possible for us to still reach a conclusion that the companies with an international touch are better managed and offer pleasant experiences to customers and employees alike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b0cda9bcf0adbec3.jpeg><p class=align-left>Some analysts have contended that the good performance of international companies over their local counterparts in a similar industry is the prior research that they do before entering a market, a well-funded entry, and the scope of operations. The scope of operation of most international companies located in the country is beyond the country itself. Most focus on regional opportunities. Some keep their focus on the larger eastern Africa region, others include the central African region, and indeed many others have their focus on a continental scale of operations. This somewhat ensures that they don’t have to intensely focus on the small market in one country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/750623d3de43fbd7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 richest people in Tanzania in 2024 and their net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In some industries, the international companies have to outdo one another. Some areas like motor vehicle assembling do not really have a local counterpart. The competition is between companies from Europe and the Asian giants. It is dominated by companies like Toyota, Mitsubishi, General Motors, Volkswagen, and other companies incorporated in Kenya such as AVA, KVA, DT Dobie but assembling for companies like Hyundai and Volkswagen. The market scope is also pretty much the same for the companies.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Kenyans to soon cruise on a 120 Kph superhighway as Uhuru Kenyatta embarks on legacy projects</p><p class=align-left>The intense competition between equals with similar financial status and market focus gives rise to enhancements in management and operational efficiency. The international focus also ensures that company management in the country of incorporation is more keen on costs and revenues since they will soon or later have to explain the performance or profitability of a venture in a particular market. This helps to keep divisional managers on their toes leading to superior performance as compared with the laxity we at times witness in the management of locally incorporated companies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d579baf17bc3e32d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>25 most admired African brands</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlWxocW9doba0wIxqbGahnqmys7rAraCoppGheqS7zKmYp6GVqHqssc2ymGZqYGd9b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f263187-list-15-international-companies-kenya-2020-html.html&text=List%20of%2015%20best%20international%20companies%20in%20Kenya%20in%202020&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f263187-list-15-international-companies-kenya-2020-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f263187-list-15-international-companies-kenya-2020-html.html&title=List%20of%2015%20best%20international%20companies%20in%20Kenya%20in%202020" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f263187-list-15-international-companies-kenya-2020-html.html&title=List%20of%2015%20best%20international%20companies%20in%20Kenya%20in%202020" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f263187-list-15-international-companies-kenya-2020-html.html&title=List%20of%2015%20best%20international%20companies%20in%20Kenya%20in%202020" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f263187-list-15-international-companies-kenya-2020-html.html&description=List%20of%2015%20best%20international%20companies%20in%20Kenya%20in%202020" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./men-need-purses.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikToker Argues Why More Men Need to Carry Around Purses">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./crimes-against-food-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Instagram Account Posts the Most Egregious Crimes Against Food, and It's Horrifying">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
