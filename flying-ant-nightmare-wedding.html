People who have never thought about floral arrangements a day of their lives are suddenly furiously arguing over orchids versus lilies. Will there be a DJ or a full band, and don't even get me started on the seating arrangement. Try finding six people who can tolerate one table together.</p><p>However, it's all worth it once the happy couple reaches that magical day. Sadly, sometimes the day is less than magical, which is what happened to this <a href=#>TikToker's</a> sister-in-law when her big day became a series of unfortunate events. Have you ever been besieged by flying ants while trying to say "I do"? It's a big I don't.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@maryashlee1 (video still)</a><p>A lot of bad luck is coming.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Everything that could go wrong at this wedding, went wrong.</h2><p>Mary Ashlee, who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@maryashlee1</a> on TikTok, casually applied makeup while sharing this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">truly cursed wedding story</a>. "So, my sister-in-law was supposed to get married in October, at the beach," she shared. "But, she and her husband decided to make it small by getting married at my in-laws' lake house." Like The Fast and the Furious, this ceremony was all about family.</p><p>First, Mary's adorable dog got a little too excited and gave the bride's father a fat lip after jumping up to greet him when he bent down to pick something up. OK, that's not too bad. Eating might be painful but he can still walk his daughter down the aisle. Then came dinner the night before the big day. "Now, this is where the actual insanity happens," warned Mary.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@maryashlee1 href=#>@maryashlee1</a><p>Everyones okay thank goodness but i need a vacation lol <a title=weddingstorytime href=#>#weddingstorytime</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=grwm href=#>#grwm</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Mary Ashlee" href=#>♬ original sound - Mary Ashlee</a></figure><p>While they were eating at a "beautiful-five star garden restaurant," Mary's mother-in-law started talking about how her stomach was hurting. Suddenly she passed out and when Mary's sister looked at this woman's eyes, they were "black." She also wasn't breathing, which prompted a 911 call. After the ambulance scooped up Mary's mother-in-law, another accident occurred.</p><p>While walking to the car, presumably to meet the mother-in-law at the hospital, one of the girls tripped and broke her foot. Here's the extra bad news: That girl was officiating the wedding. Thankfully she was still able to do so while sitting down, but that's two trips to a hospital for one wedding. I don't like these odds.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@maryashlee1 (video still)</a><p>Two trips to the hospital for one wedding.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Things can always get worse.</h2><p>I'd like to circle back to the mother-in-law, who was able to leave the hospital. Evidently her vagus nerve decided to act up. I guess what happens in the vagus nerve doesn't always stay in the vagus nerve. But again, Mary assured everyone she was fine.</p><p>Everyone was finally able to leave the hospital at 11 p.m., giving them enough time for a good night's sleep. But before the ceremony could even begin, the beach had to be rebuilt. What a crazy thing to say. The wedding was set to start as soon as the ground had returned. You see, a storm had washed the beach away two days prior (which begs the question, why still have it on this nonexistent beach?). Anyway, the beach was returned like so much missing airport luggage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@maryashlee1 (video still)</a><p>Is this the wrath of God?</p></figure><p>While doing her sister-in-law's hair, Mary was informed by her husband that flying ants had arrived at the wedding, and they didn't even R.S.V.P.! It was two hours until the wedding, and the flying ants were "falling from the sky."</p><p>This Biblical event was so shocking to the groom that he immediately dropped the cake. And finally, a thunderclap ushering rain hit the wedding as it was ending. "But, the show went on," exclaimed Mary! It sounds more like the s--- show went on, but at least it happened!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7m6tc2gZJqmpGK7qrPHraSaqpVixKaww6KloA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fflying-ant-nightmare-wedding.html&text=Flying%20Ants%20Show%20up%20as%20Guests%20to%20This%20Nightmare%20Wedding&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fflying-ant-nightmare-wedding.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fflying-ant-nightmare-wedding.html&title=Flying%20Ants%20Show%20up%20as%20Guests%20to%20This%20Nightmare%20Wedding" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fflying-ant-nightmare-wedding.html&title=Flying%20Ants%20Show%20up%20as%20Guests%20to%20This%20Nightmare%20Wedding" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fflying-ant-nightmare-wedding.html&title=Flying%20Ants%20Show%20up%20as%20Guests%20to%20This%20Nightmare%20Wedding" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fflying-ant-nightmare-wedding.html&description=Flying%20Ants%20Show%20up%20as%20Guests%20to%20This%20Nightmare%20Wedding" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./peter-of-psquare-dumps-music-joins-nollywood-industry-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Of Psquare 'Dumps' Music Joins Nollywood Industry |Photos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-captain-luthor-superman-and-lois.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Captain Luthor's Backstory Has Been Revealed on 'Superman &amp;amp; Lois'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
