See what they're up to this season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>A few years ago on <a href=#>7 Little Johnstons</a>, fans watched as <a href=#>Elizabeth Johnston</a> went through her very first breakup. The teen was devastated when <a href=#>her boyfriend, James</a>, sent her a text ending their relationship.</p><p>"I guess you can say I am angry but I have to put on the mask and show that I am OK," the reality star said at the time. But her heartache didn’t last long. Elizabeth now has a new man in her life, and their relationship is now stronger than ever. Keep reading for more information about the duo.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Elizabeth Johnston’s new boyfriend?</h2><p>The blonde beauty is dating <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brice Bolden</a>. Brice first popped up on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth’s Twitter</a> in February 2019, though at the time, she referred to the fellow Georgia native as a "great friend." A few days later, the soccer player posted a pic of Brice’s promposal, which included a sign that read, "It would be my goal to go to prom with you."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>It became apparent on Valentine’s Day that the pair was more than just friends when Elizabeth showed off the roses she received from the senior on social media. The smitten athlete gushed about her junior prom experience and shared photos of Brice on her arm. "It was a great night with this dude," she adorably tweeted.</p><p>Fans were thrilled to see Elizabeth looking so happy after witnessing her split with James. "Y’all are great together! Just saying!" one Instagram follower wrote earlier this month. Another added, "Perfect example of when a door closes, God opens a window."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Brice and Elizabeth still together?</h2><p>Now, more than two years after the pair's first social media appearance, we get to watch their relationship play out on screen. In a clip from September 2021, it was revealed that the two were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thinking about moving in together</a>.</p><p>"Brice is definitely 100 percent a guy that I would like to be with for the rest of my life," Elizabeth said. "He is definitely a kind, genuine, loving, caring guy and he gets along great with my family, and those are the features that I absolutely love about him. It's kinda sealed the deal for me to seeing and having a future with him."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Love loving on you...and Cruiser😉❤️</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>E{liz}abeth Johnston</a> (@lizzzjohnston) on Jul 13, 2019 at 5:54pm PDT</p></figure><p>Elizabeth has talked openly about her insecurities when it comes to dating, noting that most people are stuck on the fact she's a little person, but for Brice, it's not an issue at all.</p><p>"Liz is great. I love being with her, and I would love to be with her for a very long time — if she wants me to," he said, visibly blushing. "She's just been too amazing, so like, how could I not [stay with her]? I mean, I could never leave her."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened with James?</h2><p>The couple’s breakup came as a surprise to many viewers given how serious their relationship seemed to be. Elizabeth’s parents, <a href=#>Trent</a> and Amber, were also big fans of James.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"Amber and I caught on very quickly, with us being little people and with Elizabeth being a little person, that it was not an issue for James," Trent previously shared. "He wasn't interested in a little person. He was interested in Elizabeth."</p><p>Amber agreed, adding, "In relationships like this, whether it's a person in a wheelchair or a little person, you're always going to catch flak like that. If the two people in that relationship ... it doesn't matter to them, that is what's important. And clearly, with James and Elizabeth, it doesn't matter to James that Elizabeth is little."</p><p>But a couple of weeks after James ended things, he posted a photo with another girl. "It hurts just seeing him move on so quickly," Elizabeth admitted. "I miss him a heck of a lot."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Luckily, the painter received a lot of support from her dedicated social media followers. "I just watched your show and it reminded me of my first break up. It will be one of many kiddo!" one person wrote. "You are beautiful and have a lot going for you. Keep that strong bond with your family. They will always be your best cheerleaders."</p><p>A second fan added, "Really pretty girl ... Don’t be sad about James he doesn’t deserve you anyway."</p><p>Watch new episodes of 7 Little Johnstons Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmqxsCbnK2gXZ%2B8qbrSraanZZ6axG6uzrKdq6GVo7E%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2felizabeth-johnston-new-boyfriend.html&text=Elizabeth%20Johnston%20and%20Boyfriend%20Brice%20Are%20Happier%20Than%20Ever&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2felizabeth-johnston-new-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2felizabeth-johnston-new-boyfriend.html&title=Elizabeth%20Johnston%20and%20Boyfriend%20Brice%20Are%20Happier%20Than%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2felizabeth-johnston-new-boyfriend.html&title=Elizabeth%20Johnston%20and%20Boyfriend%20Brice%20Are%20Happier%20Than%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2felizabeth-johnston-new-boyfriend.html&title=Elizabeth%20Johnston%20and%20Boyfriend%20Brice%20Are%20Happier%20Than%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2felizabeth-johnston-new-boyfriend.html&description=Elizabeth%20Johnston%20and%20Boyfriend%20Brice%20Are%20Happier%20Than%20Ever" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./troy-baker-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Troy Baker - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ben-simmons-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Simmons - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
