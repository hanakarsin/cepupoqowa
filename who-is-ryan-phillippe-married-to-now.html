After having two children together, daughter Ava Phillippe, 21, and son Deacon Phillippe, 17, the actors separated in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>So, did Ryan ever remarry after his divorce from the award-winning actress?

"I think more of the problem was age. When we got together we were so young," Ryan told Larry King in a 2015 interview. “I think it can create issues with two people in this industry because there's so much noise that goes along with it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Just two years later, Reese echoed a similar statement on ITV, explaining, “I got married when I was 23 and I had two kids by the time I was 27. So I don’t know, you know, sometimes it’s good to know yourself." She then added, "I would never change anything ... I've said to my daughter, I think, you know, [at] 25, you start to know yourself a little bit better."</p><p>While Ryan has not married again following his 2007 divorce from Reese, he did come close. In 2011, the Shooter star was involved with then-21-year-old model and Pitch Perfect star Alexis Knapp. Following a short summer fling, Alexis and Ryan welcomed a baby girl, Kai. However, the two decided to end their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by AlexisKnapp (@alexisknapp)</a></p></figure><p>After the birth of his third child, Ryan dated Paulina Slagter on-and-off for five years before the couple eventually got engaged.
