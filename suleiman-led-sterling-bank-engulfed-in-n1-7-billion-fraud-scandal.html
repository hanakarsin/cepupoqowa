M. Anana, the witness testified that preliminary investigation by the bank revealed that the second defendant’s profile, Isituah, a female, was used to initiate the account on internet banking and more than 24 accounts got the same amount of money.</p><p>“Investigation letters were sent to FCMB, Zenith, First Bank, Fidelity Bank and Access Bank. Responses were received from the banks and the statement of accounts were analysed. The analysis revealed that most of the company’s accounts the money was transferred to were BDC (Bureau de Change).</p><p>“Some of them reside in Abuja, Kaduna and there was one address that we suspected to live in Lagos, Ndifreke Roberts. But all efforts to trace the address of Kaduna, Lagos and Abuja suspects did not yield any information to help the commission get them.</p><p>“On March 10, 2020, the DSS handed over the two defendants to the commission under the instruction of the AGF (attorney-general of the Federation) for further investigation. The two defendants’ statements were voluntarily taken under caution.</p><p>“The first defendant revealed that he has a company called Universal Agriculture Empowerment Initiative as an NGO which received the sum of N60 million as part of the transfer from that Sterling Bank customer’s account. He further stated that the money was received from one Osaretin (second defendant) and transferred to his account as a donation.</p><p>“That he introduced one of his friends who is the owner of Villavon International School who also received N100m from the said fraud.</p><p>“He further stated that he called a BDC in the name of Damo who owns Damoo Ten Ventures. Damo was invited to the commission and he volunteered a statement that the first defendant contacted him and he transferred N60 million to various accounts and further instructed the owner of the International School to transfer N95 million.</p><p>“The dollar equivalent was received in cash by the first defendant. The first defendant further stated that the money was used at IDP camps around the country. I cannot remember the specific location but he mentioned a place in Borno and Adamawa,” the witness said.</p><p>During cross examination by the defence lawyer, Mohammed said that Sterling Bank gave the EFCC the information that the second defendant profiled the account for the alleged fraud.</p><p>On what associated the 2nd defendant to the alleged fraud, the EFCC operative said, “The offence was committed at Sterling Bank and it was reported. The offence took place during a public holiday and the bank realized it on December 28. The accounts of the customer we are talking about has never been profiled for internet banking. So we had to understand how it was transferred, which was through internet banking.</p><p>“The bank said the account doesn’t have internet banking access and it was a staff that did it and the second defendant’s profile was used to connect the account to internet banking. Without that profiling money cannot be transferred from that account.</p><p>“Even when the bank tried to contact her, she ran away. She was nowhere to be found. Not until the Department of State Services (DSS) traced, arrested her and handed her over to the commission”.</p><p>The trial judge adjourned the case till October 19 for continuation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5BwZqytnJq2rq3NZqOenF2owaa%2By6KloGWSlrusecSnnq6klpqxbrXNZqVqZWdir6q4y6Kmp2WWp662sIysmpqmlJa5cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsuleiman-led-sterling-bank-engulfed-in-n1-7-billion-fraud-scandal.html&text=Suleiman-led%20Sterling%20Bank%20Engulfed%20In%20N1.7%20Billion%20Fraud%20Scandal&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsuleiman-led-sterling-bank-engulfed-in-n1-7-billion-fraud-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsuleiman-led-sterling-bank-engulfed-in-n1-7-billion-fraud-scandal.html&title=Suleiman-led%20Sterling%20Bank%20Engulfed%20In%20N1.7%20Billion%20Fraud%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsuleiman-led-sterling-bank-engulfed-in-n1-7-billion-fraud-scandal.html&title=Suleiman-led%20Sterling%20Bank%20Engulfed%20In%20N1.7%20Billion%20Fraud%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsuleiman-led-sterling-bank-engulfed-in-n1-7-billion-fraud-scandal.html&title=Suleiman-led%20Sterling%20Bank%20Engulfed%20In%20N1.7%20Billion%20Fraud%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsuleiman-led-sterling-bank-engulfed-in-n1-7-billion-fraud-scandal.html&description=Suleiman-led%20Sterling%20Bank%20Engulfed%20In%20N1.7%20Billion%20Fraud%20Scandal" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./2023-i-have-other-plans-pdp-presidential-aspirant-reveals.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2023: I Have Other Plans">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kaduna-lg-elections-why-pdp-won-in-my-polling-unit-el-rufai.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kaduna LG Elections: Why PDP Won In My Polling Unit">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
