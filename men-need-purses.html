A few days ago I bought this bag at the hardware store," the bearded, shirtless man states as he walks out of his home and outdoors. He holds the bag up to the camera and begins to share the revelation he experienced upon purchasing the bag.</p><p>"I've been putting miscellaneous items in it. Keys, cell phone, wallet, earbuds. I feel more organized. I'm losing things less. I'm less anxious," he says, walking around the yard as he rattles off the benefits to walking around with a bag.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@daleandthezdubs href=#>@daleandthezdubs</a><p>Purse life is the life for me <a title=manpurse href=#>#manpurse</a> <a title=manbag href=#>#manbag</a> <a title=murse href=#>#murse</a> <a title=daleandthezdubs href=#>#daleandthezdubs</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Dale and the ZDubs" href=#>♬ original sound - Dale and the ZDubs</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @daleandthezdubs</span></figure><p>Then, he gets down to the point of his post: "What I'm trying to say, is it took me to get to my mid thirties to realize all I needed was a purse. It's a purse," he says, allowing the bag to collapse open in front of him.</p><p>"I love it! I wanna take it to the bar," he says, laughing into the camera as his video closes out.</p><p>The age-old question of why more men don't walk around with bags is one that's weighed down on humanity for a very long time. Folks in this Reddit thread posted to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r/randomthoughts sub pondered this very question</a>.</p><p>The query was proposed by a Reddit user who was a staunch advocate of walking around with a purse and he wanted to know why others didn't engage in the practice: "I'm a male, I wear a bag/small satchel. It's just so convenient to carry things in, rather than my pockets. Plus I can carry a little extra. I know it's more common now, but I'm still surprised it's not like, universal. If you're a dude too, why don't you?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daleandthezdubs</span></figure><p>One person remarked that no matter what, they are always wearing a backpack, bypassing the need for having to carry a purse around at all times. Someone else chimed in that they liked this solution better than a purse or a satchel: "A backpack is simply superior. It can fit more, so I can go by a shop; it's comfortable, and it protects from the wind a bit."</p><p>However there were others who were about that #minimalist life and decided to embrace that by staying away from bags as much as possible: "I don't need to carry more than what fits in my pockets," they remarked.</p><p>Which started a conversation about other pocket essentials, where one person mentioned that all they needed were their phone, wallet, keys, and a pair of headphones.</p><p>Someone else added that they also carry a knife.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daleandthezdubs</span></figure><p>"Why would I need [a bag]? Keys/wallet/phone is all I need, pockets work perfectly fine. It would also be f------ annoying to have to carry something around all the time," was another person's response.</p><p>It seems that there are more and more men rocking bags when they're traipsing about their daily activities, however, at least when it comes to high-profile celebrities. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who What Wear</a> shared several photos of various artists and male runway models rocking purses.</p><p><a href=#>A$AP Rocky</a> was photographed with a jay in his mouth holding a pink purse a pair of jeans and his grandpa's blazer. <a href=#>Jacob Elordi</a> was snapped holding a yellow Louis Vuitton bag too, as was <a href=#>Bad Bunny</a> who was pictured holding a Gucci Jackie 1961 Shoulder Bag.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daleandthezdubs</span></figure><p><a href=#>David Beckham</a> went with a rectangular Goyard Grand Hotel Trunk that he held in his hand, and then a mini trunk on a strap that he wore across his body as well.</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quora</a> post discussing how people felt about the phenomenon of men walking around with purses, there was one woman who mentioned that her life would be made much, much easier if her husband just decided to carry around his own bag: "When we lived in Europe, it was a common sight and I really didn't think about it. It makes sense. My husband treats my purse like it belongs to him and loads it up with things he cannot carry in his pocket."</p><p>She added: "By the end of an outing, I am loaded down with everything in my pocketbook and the straps are digging into my shoulders. If he carried his own purse, I would not have aching shoulders and a backache. That would, however, start a new problem of 'Did he remember to pick up his purse at the sales register?'"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @daleandthezdubs</span></figure><p>What do you think of men walking around with purses? Do you think the TikToker has a point and that more guys should be walking around with some type of bag on their back? Or do you think that going the minimalist route is the way to do things?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforKvec2enJ1loKq%2FtLHS</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmen-need-purses.html&text=TikToker%20Argues%20Why%20More%20Men%20Need%20to%20Carry%20Around%20Purses&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmen-need-purses.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmen-need-purses.html&title=TikToker%20Argues%20Why%20More%20Men%20Need%20to%20Carry%20Around%20Purses" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmen-need-purses.html&title=TikToker%20Argues%20Why%20More%20Men%20Need%20to%20Carry%20Around%20Purses" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmen-need-purses.html&title=TikToker%20Argues%20Why%20More%20Men%20Need%20to%20Carry%20Around%20Purses" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmen-need-purses.html&description=TikToker%20Argues%20Why%20More%20Men%20Need%20to%20Carry%20Around%20Purses" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./we-paid-ransom-to-secure-my-nieces-release-nabeehas-uncle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="We Paid Ransom To Secure My Nieces Release">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./263187-list-15-international-companies-kenya-2020-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="List of 15 best international companies in Kenya in 2020">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
