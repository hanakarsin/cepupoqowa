Mercedes M.J. Javid's husband was arrested in 2019 after vandalizing Reza Farahan's house.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Those who have watched <a href=#>Shahs of Sunset</a> since the first season premiered in 2012 likely could never have anticipated that Mercedes "M.J." Javid and <a href=#>Reza Farahan</a>'s friendship would one day be on the rocks. In Season 8, the former best friends of 30+ years were hurling insult after insult at one another. Their drama began because Reza believed that M.J. spread a rumor his husband, Adam Neely, being unfaithful.</p><p>As for M.J.'s side of the story, she felt that Reza neglected to be a caring friend when she was in the ICU following the complicated birth of her son, Shams Feight.&nbsp;</p><p>The situation between the two continued to escalate when they saw each other for the first time in person in months at their then-co-star Sara Jeihooni's pool party. M.J. called Reza a cheater, while <a href=#>Reza accused M.J. of having 10 abortions</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Following the pool party from hell, M.J.'s husband, Tommy Feight, stormed over to Reza's home and he vandalized the outdoor area. He was subsequently arrested, and he was charged with vandalism. Because he allegedly damaged more than $400 worth of property, he also faced a felony charge.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident has continued to plague the group on Season 9 of the show. Though M.J. wants to move forward with Reza, Tommy is still upset because of the fallout from the backyard vandalism. He doesn't want Reza to meet his son, which will inevitably cause even more drama between Adam's husband and M.J. on the reality series.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did Tommy go to jail on Shahs of Sunset?</a> Find out how the drama between Reza, Adam, and Tommy all turned out, and why there's still so much lingering resentment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Tommy go to jail on 'Shahs of Sunset?'</h2><p>After security cameras caught Tommy red-handed while he threw a potted plant and flipped over some of the furniture in Reza's backyard in May of 2019, he was arrested. Tommy was also carrying a baseball bat at the time of the incident, which can be seen in the security footage.&nbsp;</p><p>Reza claimed that Tommy had called him and threatened his life, which Tommy denied (he admitted the call took place, but not that he issued death threats).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Following the incident of vandalism, Reza got a restraining order against Tommy. He was ordered to stay 100 yards away from Reza himself, his home, his place of work, his car, and his husband.&nbsp;</p><p>In July of 2019, Tommy pled not guilty to the charges of vandalism and trespassing. By September of 2019, it was reported that the reality star husband had accepted a plea deal. In this deal, Tommy would plead guilty to the charges of vandalism, but the charges of trespassing would be dropped.&nbsp;</p><p>As it was shown on Shahs of Sunset, Tommy was facing a felony charge of vandalism because Reza alleged that he damaged more than $400 worth of property.</p><p>The result of this plea deal was that Tommy received a sentence of 10 days in the L.A. County Jail. While it was initially unclear if and when Tommy did do this time in jail, M.J. confirmed that her husband spent time behind bars.&nbsp;</p><p>She posted a video of Tommy on her Instagram page in April of 2020. A commenter asked if Tommy went to jail due to the drama with Reza. M.J. simply responded "yes."</p><p>M.J. asked for the restraining order to be dropped in the Season 8 finale, and Reza agreed. However, the restraining order against Tommy was actually extended for three years. M.J. discussed this in the Season 9 episode, "The Truth Shall Sext You Free."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>"Tommy's still very, very angry because Reza pressed charges on Tommy for trespassing, and Tommy went to jail for it," M.J. said in a confessional. "And Reza extended the restraining order to three years."</p><p>Because of this, Tommy doesn't want Reza to meet Shams — which will definitely prove to be an issue as Season 9 continues.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">M.J. supported Tommy following the vandalism drama.</h2><p>As viewers of Shahs of Sunset will recall, M.J. wasn't exactly apologizing for Tommy's actions in Season 8. She explained that Tommy was defending her and their baby, and that he was remorseful as to how he handled his anger.&nbsp;</p><p>This was reiterated in the press.</p><p>"Mercedes is happily supporting her husband through this and staying strong for her family," an inside source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People </a>following Tommy's initial arrest.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>As for Tommy, he was pleased that he didn't do more permanent damage to Reza.&nbsp;</p><p>"I broke a plant. I wanted to break his legs," he said on a Season 8 episode of the show.</p><p>While Reza and Adam's marriage has been on the rocks for several seasons of the show now, it's evident that Tommy and M.J. are stronger than ever.</p><p>Shahs of Sunset airs on Sundays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledOopKaxXZy8bsDOZqGaoZxiwKmtx6w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdid-tommy-go-to-jail-shahs.html&text=Tommy%20Feight%20Went%20to%20Jail%20for%20Vandalizing%20Reza%20Farahan%20and%20Adam%20Neely%27s%20Backyard&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-tommy-go-to-jail-shahs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-tommy-go-to-jail-shahs.html&title=Tommy%20Feight%20Went%20to%20Jail%20for%20Vandalizing%20Reza%20Farahan%20and%20Adam%20Neely%27s%20Backyard" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdid-tommy-go-to-jail-shahs.html&title=Tommy%20Feight%20Went%20to%20Jail%20for%20Vandalizing%20Reza%20Farahan%20and%20Adam%20Neely%27s%20Backyard" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdid-tommy-go-to-jail-shahs.html&title=Tommy%20Feight%20Went%20to%20Jail%20for%20Vandalizing%20Reza%20Farahan%20and%20Adam%20Neely%27s%20Backyard" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-tommy-go-to-jail-shahs.html&description=Tommy%20Feight%20Went%20to%20Jail%20for%20Vandalizing%20Reza%20Farahan%20and%20Adam%20Neely%27s%20Backyard" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./breaking-wikes-camp-pulls-out-of-atikus-campaign-council.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wikes Camp Pulls Out Of Atikus Campaign Council, Insists Ayu Must Resign">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./does-fall-guys-have-voice-chat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Chat With Your Friends While You Play 'Fall Guys'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
