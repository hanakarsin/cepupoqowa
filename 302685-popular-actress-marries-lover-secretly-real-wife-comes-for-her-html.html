However, a woman claiming she is the real wife of Femi Anibaba has surfaced.</p><p>The woman, simply identified as Folape Sokoya on Facebook has cried foul on her Facebook page on Monday, making it known that she is still legally married to Femi. She also made it known that their marriage which has three children has been on for 12 years!</p><p>See below some of her Facebook posts:</p><p>However, the actress who just got wind of the news has reacted few minutes ago with an insightful press release explaining what is really happening debunking some of the rumors all in an attempt to let the public know the real truth. The press release was made available to Stella Dimokorkus.</p><p>Read below the long but detailed press release:</p><p><i><strong>Ronke Odusanya Press Statement On Husband Snatching Allegations.</strong></i></p><p><i>''I knew Femi back in 2008 through a very close friend who was in America then and not through actress Liz da Silva&nbsp;as is being speculated. When we met via phone, we got talking for while and I asked him what he does for a living and if he had a family,he told me he had children but was separated from his wife .</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;I asked him why he was separated and he said things didn't work out between them .we became friends and talked a lot on the phone and he always had time talking to me even very late American time. Gradually we got very close and I even met with his mum and siblings who lived in Lagos then but I still had my doubts about him then cos we had not seen each other eye to eye before and some men cannot be trusted .</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;One day,I got a message on my Facebook from a lady called FOLAPE SOKOYA and she asked me "do you know anyone called FEMI ANIBABA" and I said yes "he is my friend" and she went on to say "please stop talking to him cos he is my husband and I'm carrying his third child &nbsp;" . I was very shocked and embarrassed, even though I had my doubts, I didn't expect that kind of story.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;I immediately printed out the message and went to his people to show them and I called him and explained everything to him but he told me things were not going on well with both of them and asked me if I didn't wonder how he had so much time talking to me and that even if I called him anytime of the day&nbsp;he always picked my calls.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;He said they both lived in the same house but each person minded his or her own business,when he was done I warned him never to call me again. Later in May 2012 I was in America and I received a mail from him saying he heard I was around and he would like to see me that he had issues to discuss with me,I refused to see him and he went on to say he needed me more than anything because his wife had left him and taken the kids away too.I refused to see him and that was it.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;When I got back to Nigeria he still called severally and then I decided to talk to him and he told me he would buy me a ticket to come to his house and see things for myself,later in September that same year I went to America and saw that she had truly left him and ever since we got talking again.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;I AM NOT ENGAGED TO FEMI ANIBABA NEITHER AM I PLANNING TO GET MARRIED TO HIM.AS YOU READ THIS NOW WE ARE JUST FRIENDS I DONT KNOW ABOUT TOMORROW.</i></p><p><i>Please help me beg this woman not to rub my good name that I built over the years in mud . I did not snatch Femi Anibaba from her neither did I separate both of them,she is doing all this because she heard the marriage rumour and thought it is true and jumped in to use this opportunity to spoil my name without any evidence.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;She should tell everyone the truth, this is my own version and the gospel truth and Stella, Heaven is my witness . I only reacted to this because she wants to mess up my name and I don't like this rumour of me getting married to different men every year .This is my last say on this,I will not exchange words with her in the press.'</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHF%2BlXFsZqifpcKtrdFmmJysoprAtHnMmqmroZWoeq271Z6pZquVmL%2BmwMuyZKudkaF6uLXFnmScp52awG6yzqtkoZ2iY7W1ucs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f302685-popular-actress-marries-lover-secretly-real-wife-comes-for-her-html.html&text=Woman%20Comes%20For%20Popular%20Actress%20Over%20Husband%2c%20Actress%20Reacts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f302685-popular-actress-marries-lover-secretly-real-wife-comes-for-her-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f302685-popular-actress-marries-lover-secretly-real-wife-comes-for-her-html.html&title=Woman%20Comes%20For%20Popular%20Actress%20Over%20Husband%2c%20Actress%20Reacts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f302685-popular-actress-marries-lover-secretly-real-wife-comes-for-her-html.html&title=Woman%20Comes%20For%20Popular%20Actress%20Over%20Husband%2c%20Actress%20Reacts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f302685-popular-actress-marries-lover-secretly-real-wife-comes-for-her-html.html&title=Woman%20Comes%20For%20Popular%20Actress%20Over%20Husband%2c%20Actress%20Reacts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f302685-popular-actress-marries-lover-secretly-real-wife-comes-for-her-html.html&description=Woman%20Comes%20For%20Popular%20Actress%20Over%20Husband%2c%20Actress%20Reacts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eva-apio-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eva Apio - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./teresa-giudice-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Teresa Giudice - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
