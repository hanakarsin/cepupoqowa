He was always disturbing me. At a point, I decided to block him because he asked me out. However, on July 17, 2018, after a party in my school, he started chatting with me again. During one of our chats, he asked if I was a virgin and I answered yes.</p><p>“I don’t know how he got to my street that night. He called and said he was on our street. I told him that I just returned from a journey and I could not go outside. He said there was no problem and he would leave.</p><p>“I went to buy something outside when I saw him. He initially pleaded with me to follow him, but I refused. He then touched me on the shoulders. I lost my senses and obeyed him.</p><p>“He took me to his friend’s place in the Pipeline area of Idimu. He held a meeting with the friend called Michael. There was a second friend, Gbenga, with them that night. He told them that I would pass the night with them.</p><p>“The room was dark. I was there for about five days. During the period, he locked me in and only brought food to me. I told him that I wanted to go home, but he said I could not find my way home without him.”</p><p>The 26-year-old was alleged to have insisted on her staying, as he reportedly made plans to relocate her to another friend’s house.</p><p>“When his friend was going to work on Monday, he told us that we had till 3pm to leave his apartment. That was when he (Ajayi) said he was taking me to another friend’s place, but I refused. Some minutes later, the police came and rescued me,” she added.</p><p>Miracle, when asked what she thinks Ajayi does for a living, the teenager said that he believes that Ajayi is an Internet fraudster.</p><p>“From Thursday night to Monday afternoon that I was there, he did not touch me and none of his friends did.</p><p>“He told me that he works with a company at Apapa. But I believe he is into yahoo yahoo (Internet scam). He never allowed me to touch his phone. But there was a night he was asleep and he forgot to lock the phone. I picked it and open his Hangout application. I saw him chatting with a man and claiming to be a girl.</p><p>“From this incident, I have learnt not to go out at night again. I have also stopped using a phone and removed myself from the social media,” she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWloZH16e49qZqyto6WypMDEnWSfqpGqsbTAxKtkmpqUqrC1v4yfmJydkqS8rHnFnqSapJVis7O1xKebaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsuspected-fraudster-abducts-facebook-female-friend.html&text=Suspected%20Fraudster%20Abducts%20Facebook%20Female%20Friend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsuspected-fraudster-abducts-facebook-female-friend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsuspected-fraudster-abducts-facebook-female-friend.html&title=Suspected%20Fraudster%20Abducts%20Facebook%20Female%20Friend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsuspected-fraudster-abducts-facebook-female-friend.html&title=Suspected%20Fraudster%20Abducts%20Facebook%20Female%20Friend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsuspected-fraudster-abducts-facebook-female-friend.html&title=Suspected%20Fraudster%20Abducts%20Facebook%20Female%20Friend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsuspected-fraudster-abducts-facebook-female-friend.html&description=Suspected%20Fraudster%20Abducts%20Facebook%20Female%20Friend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fani-kayode-breaks-silence-on-abia-delegate-issue-in-apc-convention.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fani-Kayode Breaks Silence On Abia Delegate Issue In APC Convention">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./performancegroups.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Monty Python - Members, Ages, Trivia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
