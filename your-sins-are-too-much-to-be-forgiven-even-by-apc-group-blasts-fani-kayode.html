He has denied his estranged wife access to her four little children. A woman that carried her children for nine months.</p><p>“FFK has so many cases of corruption with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and he must answer for all his crimes.”</p><p>“Adams Oshiomhole (A former Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)) once said that once anybody joins the party, their sins are forgiven. But it will never happen in this case. We will battle it and ensure this man does not get a pat on the back for his many crimes.</p><p>“Are you aware he has had cases of corruption running with the EFCC since 2008? There is a case of N2 billion Port Harcourt runway, and he allegedly collected N26 million from the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) in 2014.</p><p>“The EFCC also arrested him in 2014 for the misappropriation of $2.1 billion earmarked for the fight against Boko Haram, he also has a N4.9 billion fraud trial, as well as another N4.6 billion money laundering charge. The man is notoriously corrupt and such men should never be seen near the corridors of power.”</p><p>Eholor also in the statement recalled the accusation by the incubent Minister of Transportation, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Rotimi Amaechi</a></strong> that Fani-Kayode during his time as Aviation Minister, collected N2billion expected to be used for the rehabilitation of the Port Harcourt International Airport runway but ended up diverting it for personal use.</p><p>He said, “Minister of Transport, Chief Rotimi Amaechi said that ‘former Rivers governor, Peter Odili’s government gave Femi Fani Kayode, former Minister of Aviation N2 billion to fix the runway of Port Harcourt International Airport. It is nowhere in the record of Aviation. I’m the Minister of Transportation, I have that record, it is not there, he went away with the N2 billion’.</p><p>“He was asked if it was an allegation against Fani-Kayode and he said ‘I’m not making an allegation, this is a statement of fact. Dr. Peter Odili in writing, the cabinet approved, and handed over N2 billion to Fani-Kayode to fix the runway at the Port Harcourt airport road that was close for two years and Femi Fani-Kayode left with the money’.</p><p>“We know he is good for nothing, we know he doesn’t deserve any position.</p><p>“A lot of people had thought he was a human being but we now know that he is a disgrace to humankind.</p><p>“So we are going to tell President Muhammadu Buhari that if in any way he considers this good for nothing man for a position in his government, it means that he is totally finished, and we are going to do a 5 million man protest to tell them that we cannot continue to allow Buhari to fix (sic) some failures from the South to his government so that he can support his grazing and banditry.”</p><p>Not done, the group charged President Buhari to also expose all those who have stolen public funds rather than allow such matters to be swept under the carpet.</p><p>It said:&nbsp;“We are not going to let him continue doing that. We are also expecting President Buhari to tell us who has stolen our money. To tell us about Ikoyi fund, tell us about the money recovered from the airport that they have refused to talk about.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49tZrKnpad6tLXNrGSaqpViwbC7jKasnKBdqbxursRmnaiql57DprqMnq2epl2Xxm6tz5xkoKqfqr1ursuaqq2rXZuur7WMpJiyp5SafA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fyour-sins-are-too-much-to-be-forgiven-even-by-apc-group-blasts-fani-kayode.html&text=Your%20Sins%20Are%20Too%20Much%20To%20Be%20Forgiven%20Even%20By%20APC&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyour-sins-are-too-much-to-be-forgiven-even-by-apc-group-blasts-fani-kayode.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyour-sins-are-too-much-to-be-forgiven-even-by-apc-group-blasts-fani-kayode.html&title=Your%20Sins%20Are%20Too%20Much%20To%20Be%20Forgiven%20Even%20By%20APC" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fyour-sins-are-too-much-to-be-forgiven-even-by-apc-group-blasts-fani-kayode.html&title=Your%20Sins%20Are%20Too%20Much%20To%20Be%20Forgiven%20Even%20By%20APC" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fyour-sins-are-too-much-to-be-forgiven-even-by-apc-group-blasts-fani-kayode.html&title=Your%20Sins%20Are%20Too%20Much%20To%20Be%20Forgiven%20Even%20By%20APC" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyour-sins-are-too-much-to-be-forgiven-even-by-apc-group-blasts-fani-kayode.html&description=Your%20Sins%20Are%20Too%20Much%20To%20Be%20Forgiven%20Even%20By%20APC" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./clayton-echard-football-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Clayton Echard Had a Promising Football Career Before 'The Bachelor'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./yellow-car-meaning-tiktok.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is the Meaning of the Yellow Cars All Over TikTok?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
