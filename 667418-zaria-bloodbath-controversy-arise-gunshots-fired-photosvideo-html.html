SB Morgen reports that the alleged assassination attempt was placed on the road in front of the sect's Baqiyya headquarters.</p><p>It was gathered that the road, which is the only artery out of Zaria towards Sokoto, was reportedly overwhelmed by the Shi’ite&nbsp;officers in the army chief’s convoy came down to negotiate a passage, but were unsuccessful.</p><p>The army claim that General Burutai, the chief of army staff (COAS),&nbsp;himself then alighted from his vehicle to negotiate passage, and this was when the alleged stoning and murder attempt began.</p><p>It was at the time when the COAS was allegedly hit, that his security detail began shooting in the air to disperse the Shi’ites.</p><p>The Shi’ites apparently did not budge and the military opened fire to cover their principal, and afterwards fled the scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt4uf5c67ae8v.jpeg><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Bloodbath In Zaria: Nigeria On The Verge Of Destruction (PHOTOS/VIDEO)</p><p>Latter reports had it that over the following&nbsp;two days, the army went after Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, the leader of the Shi’ites, at his residence.</p><p>Sources say there were gunshots and explosions through the day, and night, and by the end of Sunday, December 13, reports came through that Muhammad Turi, Zakzaky’s deputy, was killed.&nbsp;Also reported were the deaths of Zakzaky’s wife, a son, and some other senior members of the group.</p><p>By the end of Sunday there were claims that almost 200 corpses were deposited at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital’s Shika morgue.</p><p>According to some sources, the Nigerian army was forced to tackle the problem of the Shiites once and for all, due to the fact that the group poses a latent threat to the stability of the region.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt5bmlgft7fbm.jpeg><p>Security reports reveal that the Shiites have consistently defied constituted authority, with police and other security agencies too scared to engage the sect in a confrontation.</p><p class=h4><strong>Conspiracy Theories</strong></p><p>There has been speculation that&nbsp;the Shiite sect and Boko Haram might be in some kind of alliance though the latter has denounced the members of the Sufi, Shiite, and Izala sects as infidels.</p><p>It would be recalled that after two alleged suicide bombers attacked Shia Muslims on procession in the village of Dakasoye, Sheikh Ibrahim Zakzaky&nbsp;absorbed Boko Haram of the hideous crime, saying the jihadists&nbsp;had no hand in the blast.</p><p>Sheikh Zakzaky said the Department of State Service (DSS) were the real culprits of the attack which took place at Garun Mallam local government area of Kano on Friday, November 27.</p><p>The Muslim cleric said that the DSS had foreknowledge of the attack, and were only using Boko Haram as a cover up story.</p><p class=h4><strong>The Threats</strong></p><p>The Shiites' spokesman has threatened that if the government failed to listen, the sect might take legal action to seek redress.</p><p>The term legal might seem like the feud will be let for justice to take its due course, however, one must take into cognizance that this is not the first time in which such a clash has happened.</p><p>If by any chance the sect feels that they have been pushed to the wall, then one might fear that a retaliation might be in motion.</p><p>Some have reported that normalcy is gradually returning to the troubled city, as certain government offices, markets, shops and other commercial activities have resumed.&nbsp;However, all banks in the city are still closed, the tension still lingers thick in the air.</p><p>Iran is enraged over the bloody clash between the Nigerian army and members of the Shiite sect.</p><p></p><p>Following the bloodbath, the Iranian government has summoned Nigeria’s charge d’affaires, demanding that the Nigerian government&nbsp;“immediately sheds light on the incident, treats the injured, and compensate for damages”.</p><p>Shiite clerics from Iraq have blasted the Nigerian army for attacking unarmed supporters of Sheikh al-Zakzaky “just because they are opponents”.</p><p>They have called the bloodbath an “aggression", and wondered: <i>“Where is the freedom and democracy?”&nbsp;</i>Hence, they have called for a nationwide protest.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Reports just coming from Kaduna has it that the sound of heavy gunfire can be heard at Tudun area of the state. Distubing reports from Kano, Bauchi and Kebbi states emerged as well.</p><p>The question remains, with all the protests by pro-Biafra groups in the southeast, insurgency in the northeast and the Fulani herdsmen wrecking havoc in the centre; does Nigeria really need a face-off with the Shiites?</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3eDk2pvZrKRp7aiecGlpqickpbBqXnCqKWtqp%2BrsrO%2F2GaYq6Gjmnqowc2sn6iso2Kzqr7EnWSpoJ%2BpvLTCyJ2cqGaYqbqt</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f667418-zaria-bloodbath-controversy-arise-gunshots-fired-photosvideo-html.html&text=Bloodbath%20In%20Zaria%3a%20Over%20800%20Were%20Killed%20-%20Sect%20Speaks&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f667418-zaria-bloodbath-controversy-arise-gunshots-fired-photosvideo-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f667418-zaria-bloodbath-controversy-arise-gunshots-fired-photosvideo-html.html&title=Bloodbath%20In%20Zaria%3a%20Over%20800%20Were%20Killed%20-%20Sect%20Speaks" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f667418-zaria-bloodbath-controversy-arise-gunshots-fired-photosvideo-html.html&title=Bloodbath%20In%20Zaria%3a%20Over%20800%20Were%20Killed%20-%20Sect%20Speaks" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f667418-zaria-bloodbath-controversy-arise-gunshots-fired-photosvideo-html.html&title=Bloodbath%20In%20Zaria%3a%20Over%20800%20Were%20Killed%20-%20Sect%20Speaks" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f667418-zaria-bloodbath-controversy-arise-gunshots-fired-photosvideo-html.html&description=Bloodbath%20In%20Zaria%3a%20Over%20800%20Were%20Killed%20-%20Sect%20Speaks" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./danny-federici-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Federici - Trivia, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./did-they-ever-find-michael-from-girl-in-the-picture.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Suzanna Sevakis's Alleged Abuser Extended His Cruelty to Michael Anthony Hughes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
