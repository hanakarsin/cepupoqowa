He said people now look into the credibility and character of the candidates before they give them their votes.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> understands that the Archbishop stated this while delivering the sermon at the 2022 International Men’s Conference of Christ Holy Church International in Abuja on Sunday.</p><p>Okoh in his sermon entitled ‘By Faith, Give Leadership’ said it is important that people of God at this time should have their eyes open.</p><p>He admonished electorates to ensure they know the people they are giving their votes to.</p><p>The Christian leader said: “In Nigeria, things are beginning to change. Gone are those days when people vote based on the political party fielding the candidate; when once you have the ticket of a particular party, you are covered.</p><p>“Today, people are looking at individuals, their credibility, character, experience, capacities and antecedents in relation to the positions they want to occupy.”</p><p>Okoh decried the menace of vote-buying in the country’s electoral system, saying the people must begin to interrogate the plans and programmes of politicians before deciding who will get their mandate for the next four years.</p><p>He, however, cautioned politicians against making false promises to amass the people’s vote.</p><p>He said, “Nigerians have come to a point where they feel that they need to sit down and negotiate with the presidential and governorship candidates.</p><p>“We must ask them: ‘What is our portion in your administration (if elected)?’ They should be able to convince you before you can cast their votes for them. Nobody should take away your future from you. Don’t let anyone give you money to buy your conscience and four years of joy.</p><p>“To the people who are in politics, when you are making promises, make sure you are telling the people what you can fulfil.</p><p>“There’s no need to promise us you can give us heaven on earth when you know that given the realities on the ground you cannot be able to fulfil it.”</p><p>The General Superintendent of Christ Holy Church International also raised the alarm over the use of youths for political thuggery, noting that the development portended danger for the nation’s democracy.</p><h2>Political Thuggery In Nigeria Elections</h2><p>Okoh admonished Nigerian youths not to allow themselves to be used as political thugs.</p><p>He said the era of thuggery in Nigeria’s electoral system is over and the youths must positively participate in the political process.</p><p>“I am saying with a sense of duty that our youths must not give in to electoral violence.</p><p>“We must expand the space to inject new ideas into the systems. The world is moving on, and Nigeria cannot afford to be left behind.</p><p>“Nigeria, for me, is one of the best places to live in. I love Nigeria, and we must put our collective freedom to good use,”&nbsp;the Christian leader said.</p><p>According stressed that the challenges bedevilling Nigeria is not peculiar to the country. He tasked Christians to demonstrate leadership by providing hope to the rest of the country by faith in God.</p><p>He explained that “The Church is under attack, but not only in Nigeria. Globally, the truth is under attack.</p><p>“There’s no generation that had not had its own challenges. We are facing ours and must find a way to wriggle ourselves out of it.</p><p>“Some many things polarise the people at this time, but as Christians, we need to always stand together, knowing that we serve the same Lord and share in the same heritage.</p><p>“It is our unity and oneness that gives us the force to contend with whatever that opposes our very existence. When we are together, as people of God, there’s nothing we cannot conquer. Together, we can give a sense of security to our nation.</p><p>“In this (election) season, the Christians are going to provide leadership by faith, but with our two eyes opened.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5JqZpplnZ6%2Foq%2FLnmSamp%2BqwW7AzmafmqigmrtuusSwZJyZnmK9s7HSopuepqRiwLGxwKSqZqeeYrWww4ycn6uho6m2orrSZq6ipJxiw7DAxGagp2ViZX90ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-miracle-about-to-happen-new-can-president-speaks-on-how-christians-will-vote-in-2023.html&text=%27A%20Miracle%20About%20To%20Happen%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-miracle-about-to-happen-new-can-president-speaks-on-how-christians-will-vote-in-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-miracle-about-to-happen-new-can-president-speaks-on-how-christians-will-vote-in-2023.html&title=%27A%20Miracle%20About%20To%20Happen%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-miracle-about-to-happen-new-can-president-speaks-on-how-christians-will-vote-in-2023.html&title=%27A%20Miracle%20About%20To%20Happen%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-miracle-about-to-happen-new-can-president-speaks-on-how-christians-will-vote-in-2023.html&title=%27A%20Miracle%20About%20To%20Happen%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-miracle-about-to-happen-new-can-president-speaks-on-how-christians-will-vote-in-2023.html&description=%27A%20Miracle%20About%20To%20Happen%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brook-kerr-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brook Kerr - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./omicron-queen-trend-tiktok.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikTok Song Sums Up Our Feelings About COVID-19">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
