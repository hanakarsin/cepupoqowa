She has won a Critics' Choice award for her performance as Dolores Abernathy and has also been nominated for a few Golden Globes throughout her career.&nbsp;</p><p>She has risen to popularity for her iconic roles in television and film, but she is also notable for her public relationships, with one of the most high-profile ones being with her ex, singer-songwriter Marilyn Manson. She has recently accused Marilyn of abuse during their time as a couple. There have been questions from fans about what her <a href=#>dating history</a> is like and who are the other celebs she's been romantically involved with. You'll find out all that info right this way.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Evan Rachel Wood's dating history starts with Jamie Bell.</h2><p>Evan and British actor Jamie Bell first met at the 2005 Sundance Festival and appeared on the set of Green Day's music video for the band's iconic single Wake Me Up When September Ends soon afterward. Before long, they became an official couple. During their relationship, both Evan and Jamie got matching tattoos of the other's first initial. About a year later, the two broke things off.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Then she dated Marilyn Manson.</h2><p>Evan and the rockstar became an item in 2007, not too long after her split with Bell. They had an on-and-off relationship that first started when they met at a party in West Hollywood. At the time, she was 18 years old and he was 36 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>Evan was featured in Marilyn's racy music video for Heart-Shaped Glasses and in a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, she opened up about her first experiences with him. "I met somebody that promised freedom and expression and no judgments," she told the publication.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Evan and Marilyn broke up after a year of dating.</h2><p>In 2008, Evan confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that she and Marilyn were no longer together. "Manson and I both decided to take some time apart so we could concentrate on work. Someone used that opportunity to kick us while we were down and sell a completely false story," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, Evan denied rumors about Marilyn being a mean partner, saying, "[T]he person that said such horrible things about Manson being ‘controlling’ and ’emotionally abusive’ is certainly no source ‘close’ to me. Manson has been by my side and taken care of me through the best and worst times."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In 2010, Evan and Marilyn got engaged, then broke things off again.</h2><p>Things got a bit complicated and they ended up reconciling and breaking up another time, but then Marilyn popped the big question at one of his concerts in Paris.&nbsp;Seven months after he asked Wood to marry him, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that they had broken things off.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Evan has also opened up about dating women.</h2><p>Evan opened up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a> in their 2011 May issue, saying that she is bisexual and has dated women before. "Yeah, I'm more kind of like the guy when it comes to girls. I'm the dominant one," she said, talking about her love life with women.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Eventually, Evan got back together with Jamie Bell — and even married him!</h2><p>In 2011 (five years after their breakup), Evan and Jamie started it all up again. After reconnecting, they eventually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tied the knot</a> but they filed for a divorce after two years of marriage. They share a 7-year-old son, whom they co-parent together.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">On February 1, 2021, Evan posted an Instagram photo saying Manson allegedly abused her.</h2><p>She took to social media to reveal that he "started grooming [her]" as a teen and "horrifically abused [her] for years." After holding it in for years, she has finally opened up because "[she] is done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail." In the post, she also mentions that there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other victims</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood)</a></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmsOiuoyrmJyglaF6uLvOnWSdmaSeu6h5x6Kqraeirg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-dating-history.html&text=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%27s%20Dating%20History%20Includes%20Two%20Engagements%20and%20a%20Failed%20Marriage&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fevan-rachel-wood-dating-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-dating-history.html&title=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%27s%20Dating%20History%20Includes%20Two%20Engagements%20and%20a%20Failed%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-dating-history.html&title=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%27s%20Dating%20History%20Includes%20Two%20Engagements%20and%20a%20Failed%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-dating-history.html&title=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%27s%20Dating%20History%20Includes%20Two%20Engagements%20and%20a%20Failed%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fevan-rachel-wood-dating-history.html&description=Evan%20Rachel%20Wood%27s%20Dating%20History%20Includes%20Two%20Engagements%20and%20a%20Failed%20Marriage" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-jan-broberg-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Jan Broberg Now?
