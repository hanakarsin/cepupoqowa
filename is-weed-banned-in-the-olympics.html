You probably also found out after the fact, or maybe while they were anaconda-ing you around the mat, that they were stoned to the point of no return. Now, I don't know about you, but save for like two occasions, all <a href=#>weed</a> has ever made me want to do is eat junk food, watch old-school pro wrestling promos, and listen to great music. So why is it banned from the <a href=#>Olympics</a>?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is weed banned from the Olympics? Yes. Yes it is.</h2><p>You're not allowed to partake in international competition, or most other competitive sports, if you test positive for weed metabolites. USADA, the United States Anti-Doping agency has weed on its list of banned substances. Which means that athletes who have marijuana in their system will fail their USADA tests. Which also means that they won't be able to represent their country overseas.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty | Wikimedia Commons</span></figure><p>This includes the fastest woman in America right now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sha'Carri Richardson</a>. But she isn't being disqualified because marijuana is considered a performance enhancing drug, it's because the substance violates at least two of three of USADA's following rules when it comes to athletes ingesting questionable substances.</p><p>The three "tenets" are:</p><li>The substance poses a risk to an athlete's health.</li><li>It has performance enhancing potential.</li><li>It violates the "spirit" of the sport.</li><p>So which two of these tenets did Sha'Carri violate after getting lit? It'd be hard to argue that marijuana can really "enhance" someone's performance for a competition, unless we're talking about a pie eating contest.</p><p>As for there being a potential risk to an athlete's health, well, if she smoked weed then the argument could be made that the carcinogens from lighting up could play a factor in harming herself. The "spirit" of the sport is technically the other violation that she's breaking. That seems to really hedge on governing bodies' attitudes towards said sport.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Good morning and Happy Friday to everyone except the Olympic Committee, for banning Sha'Carri Richardson for weed while Michael Phelps weed-coughs gold medals.</p>— BrooklynDad_Defiant! (@mmpadellan) <a href=#>July 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>A 2011 article sponsored by<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> WADA argues</a> that using marijuana violates all three of the aforementioned rules, including the performance enhancing claim based on these side effects: improved vision, muscle relaxation and reducing spasms. However, the same argument could be made for a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and massages.</p><p>Recent legislation and widespread social acceptance of cannabinoid consumption has prompted immense outrage to Sha'Carri's Olympics ban. And David Epstein, author of The Sports Gene stated that he doesn't "think marijuana is performance enhancing, or that it should be banned in any sport."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just trying to be clear on the new rules here: So the female Olympic athletes are allowed to have a penis but not allowed to smoke weed?

The blowback that <a href=#>Michael Phelps</a> received after a picture of him holding a bong circulated the internet, shortly after he won a boatload of gold medals, shows how much more harshly Olympic athletes are judged when it comes to pot.</p><p>It's important to note that Sha'Carri used marijuana in Oregon, where recreational marijuana usage is legal. Heck, everything is legal there and honestly, which makes the reasoning for Sha'Carri's ban that was cited all the more baffling — that it was a "substance of abuse."</p><p>Sha'Carri's biological mother passed away during her Olympic trials, and after coming in first, Sha'Carri decided to take the edge off by smoking some pot in a state where it's legal to do so.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I actually think weed smoking should be an Olympic competition</p>— Young Person (@EricTrillman_) <a href=#>July 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>You know what else is legal to do in Oregon? Cocaine. Small amounts of heroin. Mushrooms. She could've partied WAY harder, but instead, she got high on a little bit of cannabis before going to the Olympics.</p><p>Will the Olympics' stance on weed change in the future? Well, according to this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slate</a> article, which references a 2018 paper from the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine, there are some promising developments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuw8Sem2aakaO7prCMoqVmrJiaerC42Kanopuj</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-weed-banned-in-the-olympics.html&text=Is%20Weed%20Banned%20in%20the%20Olympics%3f%20Here%20Are%20the%20Rules%20About%20Marijuana&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-weed-banned-in-the-olympics.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-weed-banned-in-the-olympics.html&title=Is%20Weed%20Banned%20in%20the%20Olympics%3f%20Here%20Are%20the%20Rules%20About%20Marijuana" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-weed-banned-in-the-olympics.html&title=Is%20Weed%20Banned%20in%20the%20Olympics%3f%20Here%20Are%20the%20Rules%20About%20Marijuana" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-weed-banned-in-the-olympics.html&title=Is%20Weed%20Banned%20in%20the%20Olympics%3f%20Here%20Are%20the%20Rules%20About%20Marijuana" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-weed-banned-in-the-olympics.html&description=Is%20Weed%20Banned%20in%20the%20Olympics%3f%20Here%20Are%20the%20Rules%20About%20Marijuana" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kaykayes-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="KayKayEs - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1349405-danny-gonzalez-bio-age-height-net-worth-career-married-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Danny Gonzalez bio: Age, height, net worth, career, is he married?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
