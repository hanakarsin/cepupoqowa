It was reported that the police traced one of the phones stole during operation to a man who confessed that he had bought it from Akinola. His arrest helped the police team to get to his sibling, Muyiwa and Oduntan.</p><p>The police statement reads; “The incident occurred on March 15, 2020. The brothers attacked the residence of Pa Olutokunbo, of Ikala Village in Ijebu Mushin and robbed him of the sum of N550,000. They also took three phones from his house and while the robbery was on, Pa Olutokunbo’s wife who was 72- year-old, started shouting for help.</p><p>“One of the robbers, Akinola Akeem, pulled the old woman into one of their rooms and strangled her to death. His brother, Mayowa Akeem, attempted to kill Pa Olutokunbo, but the old man pretended to have died and they left.”</p><p>According to Akinola, frustration had led him and his younger brother to join the robbery gang which led to committing the crime.</p><p>He said, “I am a motorcycle rider. Thieves stole two of my motorcycles and I became frustrated. I have gone for three robbery operations. In the first operation, I got ₦5,000 and made ₦9,000 in the second one. The third was at Ikala, where we killed the old woman.</p><p>“We got information about Pa Olutokunbo because he talked carelessly. He was in a bar and was talking about the money he had in his house. My brother overheard him and we consulted Koba (Oduntan) to prepare charms for us so that the operation would be successful. When we got there, we saw someone coming out from the man’s house and used that opportunity to gain entrance. We met four persons inside the house. The old woman started shouting and I took her into the room. She died while I was pulling her. My brother asked the man for the money in his house and he gave us N15,000.”</p><p>“He held the man and threatened to kill him if he didn’t give us more money. The man begged and went into his room and brought out a bag containing money and gave it to us. We saw charms on the money and informed Koba about it on the phone.”</p><p>According to him, the herbalist had warned them not to touch the money and asked them to bring it to his house immediately.</p><p>“We took the bag to him and he gave me N60,000 and my brother N50,000. Before then Koba, had told my brother and me that he could prepare rituals for us that would make us rich and he asked us to get the sum of N100,000 but because we couldn’t get the money, we decided to rob him. We gave him N100,000 out of our share.”</p><p>“He prepared soap for us and asked us to bathe with it. At the end, we did not get a dime. Koba fooled us. My brother and I were looking for a way of fighting him to get back our money when the police arrested us,”&nbsp;Akin noted.</p><p>He added, “They came to me complaining that they were poor and wanted to be rich. I asked them to get N100,000 so I could prepare ritual for them. They said they didn’t have money. They later came to me that they heard that an old man had money in his house and they wanted to rob him.</p><p>“I consulted my oracle and it informed me that there was indeed money in the man’s house. I gave them charms which would enable them to get into the house and steal the money. They got the money and brought it to me. They gave me N100,000 to prepare ritual for them which I did but I don’t know why it didn’t work for them. My charms are potent.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH14e5FuZqGdomK1tr%2FBmqWdZaSWuay%2FjJyYq52cmsC0uNhmmK1lpJ2ybq7Aq2SsmZmZerO7wZucq6tdrLWwecqio6WdlGKEc3nYnpirZZ%2BhsW6z0ZqlnaWRZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fher-husband-talks-carelessly-at-the-bar-said-robbers-who-killed-72-year-old-grandma.html&text=Her%20Husband%20Talks%20Carelessly%20At%20The%20Bar&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fher-husband-talks-carelessly-at-the-bar-said-robbers-who-killed-72-year-old-grandma.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fher-husband-talks-carelessly-at-the-bar-said-robbers-who-killed-72-year-old-grandma.html&title=Her%20Husband%20Talks%20Carelessly%20At%20The%20Bar" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fher-husband-talks-carelessly-at-the-bar-said-robbers-who-killed-72-year-old-grandma.html&title=Her%20Husband%20Talks%20Carelessly%20At%20The%20Bar" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fher-husband-talks-carelessly-at-the-bar-said-robbers-who-killed-72-year-old-grandma.html&title=Her%20Husband%20Talks%20Carelessly%20At%20The%20Bar" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fher-husband-talks-carelessly-at-the-bar-said-robbers-who-killed-72-year-old-grandma.html&description=Her%20Husband%20Talks%20Carelessly%20At%20The%20Bar" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mace-coronel-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mace Coronel - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./endsars-lekki-toll-gate-victims-confess-to-panel-on-shooting-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="#ENDSARS: Lekki Toll Gate Victims Narrate Their Ordeals To Panel On Shooting">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
