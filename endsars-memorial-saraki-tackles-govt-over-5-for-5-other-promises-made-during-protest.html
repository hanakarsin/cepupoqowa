Instead, several young people are still held in detention facilities across the country without trial.”</p><p>Saraki stated that instead of the police to protect the citizen, the Nigerian Police have resorted to threatening the public.</p><p>“It appears that the lessons that ought to be learned from the events last year have been lost. This is why rather than mobilise to safeguard and protect citizens, the Nigerian Police have resorted to threats and mobilisation to prevent further expressions of dissatisfaction with the status quo. It is my sincere hope that common sense will prevail and the young people who seek to hold events to mark the first anniversary of the events at the Lekki Toll Gate will be allowed to peacefully gather and be protected from any forms of violence.</p><p>“The carnage that followed the attacks on protesters by security agencies and non-state actors must stand as a lesson to governments at all levels that they must learn to engage with the Nigerian populace in a manner that preserves and respects their constitutional rights and freedoms or face the risk of creating an atmosphere that enables a breakdown of law and order,” he said.</p><p>The ex-Senate President further appealed to the Nigerian government to reform the police and justice sector.</p><p>“Today represents an opportunity for the government to begin the police and justice sector reforms our country so badly needs. It is an opportunity I appeal to the government to take. This is the only way we can honour the memory of those who gave their lives for this cause,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FpZp6mlKius7%2BMppymp6Kerq150pqpmqOZYsGir8qlnKxll6TDtXnOr5yrZWVis7C%2BjG5kqKyYmr9uvNGopKKrlah6rq3DnmSdraKeu6h5z6umrZ2jqXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fendsars-memorial-saraki-tackles-govt-over-5-for-5-other-promises-made-during-protest.html&text=Saraki%20Tackles%20Govt%20Over%205%20For%205%2c%20Other%20Promises%20Made%20During%20Protest&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fendsars-memorial-saraki-tackles-govt-over-5-for-5-other-promises-made-during-protest.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fendsars-memorial-saraki-tackles-govt-over-5-for-5-other-promises-made-during-protest.html&title=Saraki%20Tackles%20Govt%20Over%205%20For%205%2c%20Other%20Promises%20Made%20During%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fendsars-memorial-saraki-tackles-govt-over-5-for-5-other-promises-made-during-protest.html&title=Saraki%20Tackles%20Govt%20Over%205%20For%205%2c%20Other%20Promises%20Made%20During%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fendsars-memorial-saraki-tackles-govt-over-5-for-5-other-promises-made-during-protest.html&title=Saraki%20Tackles%20Govt%20Over%205%20For%205%2c%20Other%20Promises%20Made%20During%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fendsars-memorial-saraki-tackles-govt-over-5-for-5-other-promises-made-during-protest.html&description=Saraki%20Tackles%20Govt%20Over%205%20For%205%2c%20Other%20Promises%20Made%20During%20Protest" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./710214-7-firewood-traders-still-missing-boko-haram-strike-borno-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Boko Haram attacks firewood traders in Borno">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mica-burton-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mica Burton - Age, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
