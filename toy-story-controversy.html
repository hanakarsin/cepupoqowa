While it's easy to judge the seemingly miniscule hills people are willing to die on, a lot of times the outrage to the outrage that people are having to specific phenomenon is not even real. Just look at the recent <a href=#>Toy Story</a> controversy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">No, people don't want Woody removed from 'Toy Story' because the movie is racist.</h2><p>In a brilliantly constructed satire post from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyWire</a>, penned by Victor Dweck, the article shows off some tweets that depict anger over Woody's involvement in the Toy Story franchise because of his "genocidal" actions as a cowboy against Native Americans. In this fictional scenario, Dweck lampooned the familiar story of people calling for the removal of a character or actor with another, more "viable" alternative.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney Pixar</span></figure><p>In this instance, folks were fake-clamoring for Woody to be replaced with Chief Powhatan from Pocahontas. Again, these are fake tweets, people, as are the follow-up tweets from Tom Hanks that stated he realizes "the character Woody is offensive, harmful, and insensitive" and "it is something [he] will regret forever."</p><p>The satire piece could be likened to recent controversy surrounding Lin Manuel-Miranda's ridiculously successful Broadway musical sensation Hamilton that was initially praised (and attacked) for having one of the most ethnically diverse cast of any massive stage production ever. Years later, after the musical had debuted on Disney+, many viewers were angry that the play "glorified" slave-owning founding fathers.</p><p>Lin Manuel-Miranda, much like the fake Tom Hanks in the DailyWire article who not only apologized for playing Woody but then donated $75 million to the Harrah's in Atlantic City, also apologized for his play, saying that people's criticisms of it are valid. To Lin's credit, he didn't donate a bunch of money to a casino, however.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>YES.ðŸ˜Ÿ..... my friends of the Left have come to a decision....

No harm no foul, right? But the problem arises when he tells them that he'll get them a role in Toy Story 3. Obviously, the #MeToo movement highlighted just how grimy folks thought the joke was and Disney was pretty proactive in removing it from all versions of the flick, although it still lives on in some after-credits "bloopers."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This "casting couch" scene from TOY STORY 2 (1999) was quietly removed from the new 4K Ultra HD restoration of the film.

But the scene was included and intentionally not announced prior to the movie release in hopes it would be kept quiet to expose as many children as possible."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Remember the people who hate trans folks also hate lesbians just as much.</p><p>One Million Moms: Boycott Toy Story 4!</p><p>Me: Why?</p><p>OMM: Lesbians in the background!</p><p>Me: Were they having sex or something?</p><p>OMM: No, they picked their kid up from daycare!</p><p>Me: And?</p><p>OMM: Hugged their kid!</p>â€” Cassandra of Troy (@BrynnTannehill) <a href=#>July 10, 2019</a></figure><p>They also had a problem with the line of "not hiding in a closet..." because the toys in the film, you know, literally hide in a closet in which they were placed, "Some children may not catch this reference, but it was extremely unnecessary."</p><p>Who knew a movie about sentient children's toys would cause so much controversy?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqby6edKtpquxXZi8r8DRqK2eqqOu</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftoy-story-controversy.html&text=No%2c%20Woke%20Culture%20Does%20Not%20Want%20Woody%20Removed%20From%20%27Toy%20Story%27%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftoy-story-controversy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftoy-story-controversy.html&title=No%2c%20Woke%20Culture%20Does%20Not%20Want%20Woody%20Removed%20From%20%27Toy%20Story%27%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftoy-story-controversy.html&title=No%2c%20Woke%20Culture%20Does%20Not%20Want%20Woody%20Removed%20From%20%27Toy%20Story%27%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftoy-story-controversy.html&title=No%2c%20Woke%20Culture%20Does%20Not%20Want%20Woody%20Removed%20From%20%27Toy%20Story%27%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftoy-story-controversy.html&description=No%2c%20Woke%20Culture%20Does%20Not%20Want%20Woody%20Removed%20From%20%27Toy%20Story%27%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-was-vanessa-barcelo-from-baking-impossible-arrested.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanessa Barcelo Is Hoping that 'Baking Impossible' Will Allow Her to Reclaim Her Own Story">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1129242-former-us-ambassador-speaks-corruption-nigeria-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Former US ambassador speaks about corruption in Nigeria">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
