So she moved in. When she got there, she met another friend called Prosper who according to her is one of my biggest fans and he was also living in a separate room in the same house. After a while he satrted making sexual advances towards her which she declined. On good Friday, April 18th, he attempted raping but she threatened to kill him and go to jail if he ever tried it. After that incident, she moved out of the house into Hilton Hotel, Sandton that same day.</p><p>The next day, she said she got a call from Prince Eke that Prosper and some people were coming to meet me at the hotel and she said no problem, only for her to open her door and she saw three policemen with Prosper who claimed she stole his $3,200. She was arrested by the police but however released the following day, being April 20, 2014, Easter Sunday.</p><p>Angela has vowed to take up the matter in a reputable law court after she discovered that Prosper's job is to defraud strangers who have come with money for a project and he also works hand in hand with the police.</p><p>She is also angry with Prince Ekeh who according to her, she paid his flight ticket and accommodation to help him and his family because his wife, Muma Gee has been the only one assisting his career, only for him to pay her back with cheap blackmail.</p><p>"<i>Prince is an ingrate. I paid for his ticket from Port Harcourt to Lagos and from Lagos to South Africa He was not even happy that my passport was released to me. I keep asking myself why? what does he want to achieve? Anyway, I have told him and his accomplice who tried to rape and blackmail me that I am taking this up in a reputable law court</i>” she said</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkg3aAj3BloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f65407-html.html&text=Nollywood%20Actress%20Accused%20Of%20Stealing%20In%20South%20Africa%20Recounts%20Ordeal&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f65407-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f65407-html.html&title=Nollywood%20Actress%20Accused%20Of%20Stealing%20In%20South%20Africa%20Recounts%20Ordeal" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f65407-html.html&title=Nollywood%20Actress%20Accused%20Of%20Stealing%20In%20South%20Africa%20Recounts%20Ordeal" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f65407-html.html&title=Nollywood%20Actress%20Accused%20Of%20Stealing%20In%20South%20Africa%20Recounts%20Ordeal" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f65407-html.html&description=Nollywood%20Actress%20Accused%20Of%20Stealing%20In%20South%20Africa%20Recounts%20Ordeal" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./67754-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Amaechi-led NGF Compels Governor's To Perform">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./names-of-all-apc-pdp-candidates-for-lagos-lg-elections-full-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Names Of All APC/PDP Candidates For Lagos LG Elections [Full List]">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
