Goddy continued to amend his age on his cv until it got to a point he did not even go to primary school.</p><p class=p1>“He had to remove primary school completely because he’s trying to amend his age to be young to be able to get a job.</p><p class=p1>“Now Goddy has joined politics but Goddy is in dilemma because he has forged&nbsp;his age so many times&nbsp;because of job opportunity he was trying to get but now Goddy has his CVs with different ages.”</p><p class=p1>He added that it has become a source of petition against Goddy.</p><p class=p1>The contribution surprised his colleagues with the presiding officer, <a href=# rel=noopener>Godswill Akpabio</a> saying, “you are saying that your friend was forging. Because of this situation, your friend has remained a forger and you have not corrected him that forgery is a crime.</p><p class=p1>“He has forged his age that he has now eliminated his (true date of birth). He was born after his primary school. That was what you said.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t know what you did as a distinguished member of this society to correct the continuous forgery.”</p><p class=p1>But the senator again rose&nbsp;to defend himself saying, “that’s why senator Abba moro moved this motion. This motion would help us to correct that.”</p><p class=p1>“What did you do when you noticed that he had forged his age declaration to the point where he was now born after his primary school education? What did you do?,” Akpabio further probed.</p><p class=p1>“Of course Mr president, I advised against it because I know the implication. I can’t support such,” he responded.</p><p class=p1>“Thank you for your contribution that you are in sympathy with the motion,” Akpabio added.</p><p>The Senate, accordingly, urged the federal ministry of labour and employment to immediately draw up policies that relate to equality, opportunity and treatment of access to employment at all levels.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5ByZp2qkaKubq3SZqasoJmkuqm7y55krZmToLmmv4yamZuZXZbBbr%2FEp5itnV2luaa6wKuwaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrama-as-oshiomhole-tackles-abba-at-senate-plenary.html&text=Drama%20As%20Oshiomhole%20Tackles%20Abba%20At%20Senate%20Plenary&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrama-as-oshiomhole-tackles-abba-at-senate-plenary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrama-as-oshiomhole-tackles-abba-at-senate-plenary.html&title=Drama%20As%20Oshiomhole%20Tackles%20Abba%20At%20Senate%20Plenary" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrama-as-oshiomhole-tackles-abba-at-senate-plenary.html&title=Drama%20As%20Oshiomhole%20Tackles%20Abba%20At%20Senate%20Plenary" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrama-as-oshiomhole-tackles-abba-at-senate-plenary.html&title=Drama%20As%20Oshiomhole%20Tackles%20Abba%20At%20Senate%20Plenary" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrama-as-oshiomhole-tackles-abba-at-senate-plenary.html&description=Drama%20As%20Oshiomhole%20Tackles%20Abba%20At%20Senate%20Plenary" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1437598-nigeria-govt-spends-n580-trillion-months-61-borrowed-countries-others-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigerian Government Spends N5.80tn in Six Months, But 61% of it was Borrowed from Countries, IMF, Wo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./apc-speaks-on-gov-bello-conceding-nwc-positions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="APC Speaks On Gov Bello Conceding NWC Positions">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
