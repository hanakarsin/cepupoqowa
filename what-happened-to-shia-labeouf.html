From arrests, to alleged fights with his ex-girlfriend, the entertainer has been involved in a series of criminal mishaps.</p><p>Shia rose to fame as the star of Disney Channel’s Even Stevens, which aired from 2000 to 2003. Following the success of the show, Shia went on to appear in Holes, Transformers, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</p><p>In addition to his budding career, Shia found himself in a string of controversies. Shia’s first brush with the law came in 2007 after the Tax Collector star was arrested for refusing to leave a Chicago area Walgreens at 2:25 a.m., per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TODAY</a>. Seven years later, Shia was arrested for disrupting a performance of Cabaret. The actor, who pled guilty to disorderly conduct, explained on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a> that he was drinking heavily prior to attending the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In 2017, the former child star was arrested in Georgia for public drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and obstruction, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. While detained, the actor went on a racist tirade which was captured on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>. In October 2020, Shia was charged with misdemeanor battery and petty theft after taking a man’s hat following a physical altercation. A few months later, singer <a href=#>FKA Twigs</a> filed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a> against Shia, claiming that he abused her during their relationship.</p><p>Shia and FKA Twigs have agreed to postpone the trial. The mutual decision pushed the date from Nov. 6, 2023, to Oct. 14, 2024. According to a court filing, "the parties have diligently conducted discovery, but certain discovery issues remain to be resolved.”</p><p>Basically, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online</a> reported, there are still disputes over some of the evidence and documents that need to be settled.</p><p>Following the slew of scandals, Shia has returned to the spotlight and shows no signs of slowing down. Fans wondering what happened to the actor may be surprised to learn that his life is on a new path.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Shia LeBeouf converted to Catholicism after playing a saint.</h2><p>During a 2022 appearance on Jon Bernthal’s podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Ones</a>, Shia spoke candidly about the allegations levied by his ex-girlfriend. “I f--ked up bad,” he admitted. Adding, “[I] hurt a lot of people, and I’m fully aware of that. And I’m going to owe for the rest of my life.” He went on to profusely apologize to FKA, who he credited with saving his life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Since then, Shia has returned to acting and has also changed his personal life. He appears as the titular character in Padre Pio, which debuted in the U.S. on June 2, 2023. The film chronicles the journey of an Italian priest, Padre Pio, who later becomes one of Catholicism’s most beloved saints. While filming the movie, Shia lived in a monastery of Franciscan Capuchin friars and the experience led him to join the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>“When I got here, a switch happened … it was like someone tricked me into it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he explained</a> during a sit-down with Bishop Robert Barron. Shia added that he was battling suicidal thoughts and depression during that time but found peace thanks to Padre Pio's teachings. He said, “It was seeing other people who have sinned beyond anything I could ever conceptualize also being found in Christ that made me feel like, ‘Oh, that gives me hope.’”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Shia also explained that he was in the early stages of his conversion to Catholicism but was excited to dive deeper into his religious quest. We're glad that Shia has found balance in his personal life and wish him nothing but the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSsoJmWeq2twZ6mrp5f</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html&text=What%20Happened%20to%20Shia%20LaBeouf%20Following%20His%20Messy%20Scandals%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Shia%20LaBeouf%20Following%20His%20Messy%20Scandals%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Shia%20LaBeouf%20Following%20His%20Messy%20Scandals%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Shia%20LaBeouf%20Following%20His%20Messy%20Scandals%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-shia-labeouf.html&description=What%20Happened%20to%20Shia%20LaBeouf%20Following%20His%20Messy%20Scandals%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-mcguire-controversy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Look at the Problematic Remarks">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./does-matthew-die-discovery-of-witches.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Matthew Die in 'A Discovery of Witches'?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
