Trump, who was alright, repeatedly told the Secret Service agents who had tackled him to the ground to "let me get my shoes." This led many to wonder what happened to the shoes, and why Trump was so fixated on them in the moment.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Donald Trump's shoes?</h2><p>Trump's comments in the moments after he was tackled made it clear that he didn't have his shoes on. Given that he was at a political rally, this seemed strange. As it turns out, though, the former president had an explanation for needing his shoes, and he gave it during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Post</a>.</p><p>“The agents hit me so hard that my shoes fell off, and my shoes are tight,” he explained.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Trump ask for his shoes?</h2><p>It seems, then, that he needed his shoes because they had been knocked off of his feet. It may have seemed like a strange thing to focus on in such a dangerous moment, but it's possible that he simply didn't want to walk barefoot.</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Trump said that he believed he should be dead.</p><p>“The doctor at the hospital said he never saw anything like this, he called it a miracle," he said.</p><p>“I’m not supposed to be here. I’m supposed to be dead,” Trump continued. “I’m supposed to be dead.”</p><p>Trump said that if he had not turned his head slightly to read a chart on immigration, he would be dead, and added that he wanted to continue speaking to his supporters, but the Secret Service agents told him it would not be safe to do so. He also revealed a bruise on his arm that had come from their tackle.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This assassination attempt sent shockwaves through America.</h2><p>At a time when political polarization was already high and violence has seemed an increasing possibility, this apparent attempt on Trump's life has sent shockwaves through the world of politics in the hours since it occurred.</p><p>Trump, who will be formally nominated at the Republican National Convention the week of July 15, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly rewriting</a> his convention speech to call for unity.</p><p>While this incident has been a shock, and has led to bipartisan calls condemning political violence, Trump has celebrated such it in other contexts. When Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked, he spoke about it in joking, reverent terms at his rallies.</p><p>Now, that violence has arrived at Trump's door. He may call for unity, but there will be many who insist on reminding those watching that until July of 2024, Trump was widely seen as part of the problem.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStqqWivbR50qGmnqs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-trumps-shoes.html&text=What%20Happened%20to%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Shoes%20During%20His%20Rally%20Shooting%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-trumps-shoes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-trumps-shoes.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Shoes%20During%20His%20Rally%20Shooting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-trumps-shoes.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Shoes%20During%20His%20Rally%20Shooting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-trumps-shoes.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Shoes%20During%20His%20Rally%20Shooting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-trumps-shoes.html&description=What%20Happened%20to%20Donald%20Trump%27s%20Shoes%20During%20His%20Rally%20Shooting%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./yoojung-lee-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yoojung Lee - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nollywood-actor-leo-mezie-is-dead.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nollywood Actor, Leo Mezie Is Dead">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
