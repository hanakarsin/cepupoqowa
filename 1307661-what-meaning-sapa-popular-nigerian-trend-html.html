Sapa is a term used in Nigerian pidgin English to describe a state where one is being extremely broke or poor, usually after overspending. Many Nigerians use the term to describe a cruise, but many do not understand it. The word has been the most used on social media recently, with some singing about it.</p><h2>What is the meaning of sapa?</h2><p class=align-left>Sapa word is a type of slang used to describe <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/guides/1116681-what-10-economic-problems-facing-nigeria/ href=#>poverty in Nigeria</a>. It is often seen as disrespectful or trivializing and can cause harm by perpetuating negative stereotypes and stigmas. There are many different ways that Sapa can be used in conversation or writing. For example, you can use it:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/48a333a36bae54d5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Practice random acts of kindness and 4 other New Year resolutions to consider for 2023</span></p></a><ul><li>To express frustration at one's inability to achieve a goal or get what he wants.</li><li>To describe someone who is down on his luck or struggling financially.</li><li>It's also used to express a sense of hopelessness or mock someone perceived as "poor" or lacking in any way.</li></ul><h3>What is the origin of sapa?</h3><p class=align-left>The Sapa meaning in Nigeria is basically a style of speech that developed among specific impoverished <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/guides/1206548-types-culture-nigeria/ href=#>communities in Nigeria</a>. It originated in the northern region of Nigeria and is distinct from other regional varieties of Nigerian English.</p><p class=align-left>Many experts believe it developed as a form of linguistic resistance among marginalized people with little power in society. They used the unique features of this dialect to express their discontent and deflate the power of those with more wealth and social status.</p><p class=align-left>Over time, the word has gained popularity throughout Nigeria and was adopted by many speakers who did not belong to its original marginalized communities. Today, it is widely used in both formal and informal contexts across Nigeria and is considered an important part of its cultural heritage.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/853bb1ad602ab415.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most famous political quotes from the UK that made history</span></p></a><h3>Why is Sapa trending?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/48a333a36bae54d5.jpg><p class=align-left>Sapa, the poverty slang, is trending in Nigeria for several reasons. The two leading probable reasons are:</p><h4>1. Social media influence</h4><p class=align-left>Many Nigerians have increasingly relied on social media as a source of information. Many Nigerians get their news and <a href=#>entertainment</a> from platforms like Twitter and Facebook. That means trends like Sapa can spread quickly and reach a broad audience.</p><h4>2. Widespread poverty in Nigeria</h4><p class=align-left>Another reason is that Sapa is a funny and clever way to poke fun at the widespread poverty in Nigeria. Using this slang, Nigerians can take a light-hearted approach to their struggles, and at the same time, they highlight the serious issues they face daily.</p><p class=align-left>Ultimately, it is likely that Sapa will continue to be popular in Nigeria as long as the country remains plagued by poverty and other social issues. However, the trend may also die out as more Nigerians start to demand improvements in their quality of life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e41500687c7cfaa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is enmeshment in a relationship and how does one deal with it?</span></p></a><h3>Who commonly uses Sapa?</h3><p class=align-left>Sapa-slang is commonly used among the poor and lower middle class in Nigeria. Many people often use this slang, which contains a mix of English, pidgin, and indigenous languages. In addition, this slang allows the poor to express themselves when communicating with more wealthy individuals.</p><p class=align-left>Sapa is common in many contexts, from <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1216513-how-a-fun-conversation-girlfriend-talk-about.html href=#>casual conversations</a> with friends and family to professional interactions with colleagues. It is most commonly used to convey an emotion or a sense of connection with other individuals.</p><p class=align-left>Some people may view the use of Sapa as unprofessional or inappropriate in certain situations. However, it is widely accepted and encouraged among Nigeria's poor and lower middle class.</p><p class=align-left>While Sapa-slang originated as a way for the poor to express themselves, it is now commonly used by individuals from all backgrounds and socioeconomic classes. As more people move to Nigeria's cities for better opportunities, this slang will likely continue to grow.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/263064105e317f0f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is an Irish goodbye and where did this phrase come from?</span></p></a><h3>How to avoid Sapa</h3><p class=align-left>If you live in Nigeria, it's important to avoid using the word when discussing poverty. Poverty is a serious and complex issue that requires careful and thoughtful language to communicate accurately and compassionately. Using slang can make the issue seem trivial or disrespectful by ignoring the real problems and issues involved.</p><p class=align-left>Some other common slang terms used in Nigeria to talk about poverty include "baba do-ri," which means "father goes around." It implies that a poor man is lazy and spends his money on alcohol.</p><p class=align-left>Another common expression is "oja-oke," which means "market mattress." It implies that poor people have no purpose in life and are not contributing to society.</p><p class=align-left>Understanding the real problems and issues behind poverty in Nigeria is important to avoid using Sapa and other derogatory slang. Poverty is driven by a complex web of interconnected factors, including a lack of <a href=#>education</a>, job instability, and <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/guides/1180924-problems-agriculture-nigeria-solutions/ href=#>food insecurity.</a></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f64103c5edb7085c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Different ways on how to prepare for quarantine</span></p></a><p class=align-left>And it's important to remember that poverty is more than having little money or resources. It is also about the overall quality of life and well-being that people experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/853bb1ad602ab415.jpg><p class=align-left>To effectively communicate about poverty, it's essential to use compassionate and thoughtful language that accurately reflects the challenges faced by those living in poverty. When you use slang, you risk perpetuating stigmas and stereotypes that can negatively affect the people living in poverty.</p><p class=align-left>To be influential allies for those affected by poverty in Nigeria, it's important to avoid using slang when talking about the issue. Doing so can help ensure that they are treated with compassion and respect.</p><h3>Popular Sapa songs</h3><p class=align-left>Sapa songs are a type of <a href=#>music</a> that originated in Nigeria.
