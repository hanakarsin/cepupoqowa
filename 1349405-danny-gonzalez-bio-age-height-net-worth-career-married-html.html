In May 2013, he posted his first clip titled <i>Target Headphones Like What Up</i>. The video was temperately popular.</p><p class=align-left>Afterward, the YouTuber uploaded several other videos on Vine up until the site's closure. By then, Danny Gonzalez Vines had helped him amass a massive following totaling to about 2.8 million people. Speaking about the platform, Gonzalez acknowledged the support he received from the entire support community.</p><p class=align-left>When Danny's career was blossoming on Vine, he continued his studies, hoping to become a software engineer if his internet career failed.</p><h3>Making the switch to YouTube</h3><p class=align-left>Before Vine's closure, Danny had ventured into the popular video-sharing site, YouTube. However, he had not found it necessary to invest much time or effort in the Google-affiliated video-sharing site.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1cbbedff7781e0fd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Adam Beason biography: who is Catherine Bellâ€™s former partner?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This was due to his success on Vine. However, after the latter's closure, Danny decided to focus on creating commentary videos and uploading them on YouTube.</p><p class=align-left>He found the viewer community at YouTube just as friendly as what he had on Vine. In contrast, YouTube proved to be much more competitive in terms of the number of content creators.</p><p class=align-left>After some deliberation, Gonzalez chose to create commentary videos since one of his friends was successfully doing the same. The decision would later become the basis of his unprecedented success on YouTube.</p><p class=align-left>In 2018, Gonzalez teamed up with one of his friends to pursue an idea about a comedy tour. The project's main aim was to create evergreen content for live shows. The duo would create videos whose relevance would stretch much longer than the conventional videos on YouTube.</p><p class=align-left>After long and elaborate planning, Danny and his friend created the <i>We Are Two Different People </i>tour that kicked off in Naperville, Illinois, on 6th September 2019. This proved to be an entirely new experience for the YouTuber who was not used to performing in front of large audiences.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/35d868e3efd8f02c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Marlon Webb biography: age, net worth, Vines, where is he now?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite the <i>We Are Two Different People</i> tour having been a huge success, Gonzalez has no immediate plans of embarking on another tour any time soon. He says it was quite challenging having to handle the tour and, at the same time, create content for his channel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ed1c06145b8f53b9.jpg><h3>Music career</h3><p class=align-left>The YouTuber's interest in making music began when he was still in high school. Inspired by The Lonely Island, Danny's attempt at emulating their music marked the beginning of his singing career. In 2019, the renowned online sensation released his debut EP titled <i>Bump This</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Regarding the future of his music career, Danny says that he does not have any concrete plans and will only release songs once he gets the inspiration to do so.</p><h2>Danny Gonzalez wife</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1cbbedff7781e0fd.jpg><p class=align-left>While we know quite a lot about most YouTubers, Danny has managed to keep much of his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">family life</a> away from the public eye.
